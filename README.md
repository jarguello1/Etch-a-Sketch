# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project

In this project I used javascript to make a computerized version of an [Etch A Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch/). The focus of this project
was to use Javascript's DOM manipulation to create all the containers and content that would normally be made in an HTML file. This served as an example for
different ways javascript can be used to change an HTML file.

The result was a page that starts off as a 16x16 grid that can be filled when the mouse moves over the pixels. The grid can be resized to a new
number of boxes while still retaining it's same overall dimensions. Creating a more or less pixel dense image.
